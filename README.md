  # DATA-GOVERNANCE
# CHAPTER 1 : DEFININ DATA GOVERNANCE
# ABOUT DATA GOVERNANCE
* Data is one of the most important resources an organization possesses in today’s economy.
* When organizations don't  handle and control data that leads to missed opportunities for business growth, revenue enhancement, and the utilization of crucial insights.
* Moreover, these organizations expose themselves to increased risk in a world fraught with complicated regulatory demands and devastating cyberattacks.
* proficient data management and improved data quality can yield outstanding results for their organizations.
* Gaining a solid grasp of data governance will enable you to boost the value and quality of your organization's data, while effectively managing the risks and obligations that come with it.


# Defining Data Governance
* Data governance is grappling with a public relations challenge.
* data governance constitutes one of the most valuable initiatives that an organization can put into action at this time. 
* data governance can unlock the extraordinary potential of data, promote business expansion, and facilitate triumphant digital transformations, all the while mitigating substantial business risks.
* Once data governance is thoroughly grasped, organizations can reap its potent outcomes.
* Effective data management is crucial and should be a priority for every business leader.

# UNDERSTANDING DATA GOVERNANCE
* Data governance is a very simple concept about proactively managing yor data in order to support your organization to achieve its strategy and objectives and does this by improving the quality of your data.
* So data governance is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data.
* Need to use different policies such as :
* A pplicy to mandate how your organisation is going to manage data.
* Roles and Responsibities concerning data and processes detailing what needs to be done to manage data.

* What is meant by governance?
* Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.
* It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced.
* When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. Left ungoverned, the possibility of devolving into chaos is very probable.
* The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent.
* For example,governance in a public agency such as a city will differ greatly from that of a private enterprise.
* Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.
* Project governance, for example, is focused on a process for how project decisions are made and how communications are managed between stakeholders.
* Land governance, concerns itself with issues relative to land ownership and the rules under which decisions are made around land use and control.
*  The data needs to be accurate and current.
* Leaders want data to provide the basis for rich insights that enable timely and informed data-driven decision-making.
*  The legal department requires data to be handled by everyone in a manner consistent with laws and regulations.
* Product designers want data to inform creative decisions that align with marketplace demands and customer trends.
*  Security professionals are tasked with ensuring that the data is appropriately protected.
* To achieve these and other increasingly common business demands, you need some form of data control and accountability in your enterprise.
*  Quality results require the diligent management of your organization’s data.
* Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.
*  when data is managed well, it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise’s most abundant and important lever for success.
* Well-managed data can be transformational, and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture
* This is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers
* Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease.
* The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets (a fancy term for data with specific value to an organization, such as a customer or product record) is called enterprise information management (EIM).
* Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.


* Data Governance Versus Data Management
* Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data.
* *  For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.
* Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.

* Data Governance versus Information Governance
* Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences.
* Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.
* As a data governance practitionerbe will be  operating in both the data and information governance worlds each day.
* must understand the context of data, a concept known as data intelligence, and the desired business outcomes, to complement data governance efforts in a valuable manner.

* The Value of Data Governance
* Puts in place processes and policies to leverage the data’s value and reduce data risks, that organization is demonstrating a strong commitment to data controls and accountabilities. In other words, that organization values data governance.
* Data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.
* main advantages achieved by good data governance include:
* Improved data quality
* Expanded data value
* Increased data compliance
* Improved data-driven decision-making
* Enhanced business performance
* Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
* Increased data availability and accessibility
* Improved data search
* Reduced risks from data-related issues
* Reduced data management costs
* Established rules for handling data
* In the absence of formalized data governance, organizations will continue to struggle in achieving these advantages and may, in fact, suffer negative consequences. For example, poor-quality data that is not current, inaccurate, and incomplete can lead to operating inefficiencies and poor decision-making.


# CREATING A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM
* The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following.
* defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
* Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
* Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
* Achieving leadership approval.
* Designing and developing the program.
* Implementing the program.
* Monitoring and measuring performance.
* Maintaining the program.
*  data governance is achieved through a set of common elements.
# COMMON ELEMENTS OF A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM

# DEVELOPING A DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
* Can't buy a data governance program off the shelf.
* Regardless of how and to what degree you implement the elements of a data governance program, you’ll need a basic set of guiding concepts and a structure in which to apply them. This is called the data governance framework.
* there are many framework variations to choose from, including ISACA’s Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) IT governance framework, they share some common components that address people, processes, and technology.

# Qualities of a data governance framework

![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/7c0fcb88-211a-462a-acbf-e7521319a913)

* Leadership and Strategy
* data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.
* The disconnect between business goals and data governance is the number one reason that data governance programs fail.
*  When mapping organizational strategy to data governance, you need the support, agreement, and sponsorship of senior leadership

*  Roles and Responsibilities
*  Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.
*  Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.
*  While specific roles do exist, your organization must understand that data governance requires responsibilities from nearly everyone.


*  Policies, Processes, and Standards
* Policies, processes, and standards must include accountability and enforcement components; otherwise it’s possible they will be dead on arrival.
*  At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization.
*  Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.

*  Metrics
*  The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results.
*   Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.
*   You’ll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program.
*   Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.

*   Tools
* a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.
* many data science-related tools have made leaps in terms of incorporating ease-of-use and automation.
* What used to be complex has been democratized and empowered more team members to better manage and derive value from data.

* Communications and Collaboration
* With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key.
* This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
*  Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.
*  A large number of disparate stakeholders need to work together in order to effectively govern data.
*  Collaboration is essential and can be the difference between success and failure. Good collaboration requires a positive culture that rewards teamwork.
*   It also requires clear channels between teams, such as regular meetings. Online collaboration platforms are increasingly being used too.

# PREPARING FOR DATA GOVERNANCE
* Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it.
* if you and your team are diligent, there are some traps that you can avoid
* Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists.
* Intuitively can conclude that an immature, reactive data culture, where data is simply handled in an ad hoc manner, is an entirely different experience than a sophisticated data-driven culture.
* There are other prerequisites for data governance success, these include ensuring that the organization’s strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program.

* What is data culture?
* Data culture is an organizational culture of data-driven decision making. Organizations build a data culture because they want to make better decisions
* In a data culture, by contrast, evidence and reason are valued above all else.
* It doesn’t matter who’s talking or what tone they’re using — what matters is whether the argument makes sense given the data.
* Consensus and hierarchical cultures generally aren’t intentionally selected as preferred alternatives to data culture.
* Rather, they emerge because they’re easy. Y
*  But to be able to look at the data for answers, the data must be readily available, trustworthy, and interpretable.

* Assessing the Data Culture
* data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it.
* Effective data cultures support and empower all employees
* In a data culture, decisions don’t rely on gut feelings, guesses, or the opinion of the highest-paid/ranking person in the room. Rather, decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce.
* It’s been said that data culture is decision culture
* Data culture can be now considered a new way of doing business in the digital age.
*  implementing data governance will be a positive and important contributing factor to building a data culture.

# Maturing the Data Culture
* When it is needed to better prepare the organization for data governance by maturing the data culture,must do the following:
* Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
* Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
* Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
* Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

* Assessing Data Governance Readiness
* the success rate of data governance programs on the first try remains low.
*  It’s important to maximize the conditions for success.
*  Must check the followong to help determine the data governance readiness for organizations:
*  The basis of a data culture exists.
*  The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
*  Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
*  Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
*  One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
*  The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
*  The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
*  You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
*  Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
*  Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
*  The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.

# CHAPTER 2 : EXPLORING A WORLD OVERFLOWING WITH DATA 
* Each organization may have resource limitations that dictate the terms of their decision-making and actions
* The volume of data amassing may be the result of  day-to-day activities, products, and services, the data they have access to, or the data created and delivered by their customers and partners. Whatever the reason and source, this is the age of big data.
* overned and managed correctly, data has the potential to improve an organization’s operations and performance and increase profits and market share.

# Defining Data
* Data has a specific meaning and it’s really important to be clear on the definition
*  information is about knowledge and insights

*  Why all the focus on data?
*  Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device.
*  Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data.
*   the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts
*   Data is also defined based on its captured format.
*   Categories of Data :
*   Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
*   Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
*   Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.
*   Units of data are largely worthless until they are processed and applied
* The value that data can bring to so many functions, from product development to sales, makes it an important asset.

# The Zettabyte Era
*  We have two data types, qualitative and quantitative.
*  Qualitative which is Categorical, is non-numerical/descriptive, has two categories which are Nominal(Non-ordered) i.e ethnicity,hair color , and Ordinal (orderly) i.e class grades, date range opinions.
*  Quantitative which is Numerical , uses numbers. Has two categories which are Discrete(Countable) i.e number of facebook likes,final score of in football, and Continous(Measurable) i.e weight,temperature.
*  The "Zettabyte Era" refers to the current period in which digital data is measured in zettabytes.
*  A zettabyte is a unit of digital information storage equivalent to 1 sextillion bytes, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.
*   With the explosion of digital content, from videos and images to social media posts and sensor data, the amount of data generated and consumed globally has been rapidly increasing.
*   This era signifies not only the sheer volume of data being produced but also the challenges and opportunities it presents.
*   Managing, analyzing, and making sense of such vast amounts of data has become a critical task for businesses, governments, and individuals alike.
*    Technologies like big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have emerged to help harness the potential of this data deluge.
*    The Zettabyte Era is characterized by the ubiquity of data in everyday life, the rise of data-driven decision-making across industries, and the ongoing quest to innovate and develop new tools and strategies to effectively navigate this data-rich landscape.
*    It underscores the importance of digital literacy, data privacy, and cybersecurity in an increasingly interconnected world.

# From Data to Insight
* Data that is never used is about as useful as producing reports that nobody reads. The assumption is that you have data for a reason.
*  Data must be converted to information to have meaning.
*  Information is data in context
*  The Differences Between Data and Information
*  Data is Raw and are Items such as characters, words, pictures, and numbers that have no meaning in isolation. In data there is no analysis dependency
*  Data is Unorganized and not dependent on context
![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/4d1ba019-60d4-4961-a259-82eee5716786)
* Not typically useful alone
*  Information is Processed and is Data that is organized and given context to have meaning and Dependent on the analysis of data
*  information is organized and dependent on context
* Useful alone

* When we apply information coupled with broader contextual concepts, practical application, and experience, it becomes knowledge.
*  Knowledge is actionable. It may also give relevance to the saying that- knowledge is power.
*  With wisdom, we know what to do with knowledge and can determine its contextual validity.
*   We could have stopped at knowledge, but wisdom takes us to the ultimate destination derived from data. All wisdom includes knowledge, but not all knowledge is wisdom.
*    insight is an outcome that can emerge from knowledge but is best demonstrated through a combination of knowledge and wisdom.
*  With insight, we’ve gained a deeper understanding of something and have the skills to think or see it differently.

  # Journey fro data to insight
  ![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/61beb583-7c54-4099-bdda-77b8fdb48991)
  * the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy
  *Data leads to insight 
  * ![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/df0cd7cc-5cd2-4dec-bb48-a4da04feab6c)
* the best outcome can’t be guaranteed no matter which processes, tools, or skills are used, good practices such as the right level of data governance can absolutely lead to better results.

# The Role of Data in the 21st Century
* Since the early days of data processing in the 19th and 20th centuries right through to digital transformation in the 21st century, data has played many important roles.
*  It’s helped us understand the world in completely new ways, improved our ability to make better-informed decisions, and supported our efforts to solve all manner of problems.
*  In this way, it’s fair to say that data has always been important.
*  ince the mid-20th century, as more computer systems came online, the role of data has grown.
*  It’s not just that the quantity of data began to increase rapidly, but it was also the quality of the data and the availability of it to so many people.
*  In these early decades of the 21st century, we are producing more data than we can handle, and the depth, breadth, and quality of the data that is being used are reshaping not just the tools and capabilities of our industries and cities, but the nature of how we learn, socialize, and entertain ourselves.
*  It’s also elevating risks that we may previously have characterized as annoyances to a world today where a cyberattack can result in millions of dollars of losses in hours.

# Data-Driven Decision-Making
*  one of the greatest values of data is its ability to help us all make better decisions.
*  The availability of abundant good quality data has been a boon for decision-making.
*  if you make a decision based on bad data, your challenges will be entirely different.
*  Abundant data is a product of the 21st century, but quality data is the product of deliberate actions.
*   Data governance plays a central role when aspiring for data quality.

# Data as The New Oil
* Just as oil drove and grew economies in the past, data is doing that now.
* Some have subsequently added that just like oil, data has value but must first be processed to be useful.
*  Specifically, oil is refined to make gas, plastics, and other useful chemicals.
*  In a similar fashion, data must be organized and analyzed to understand patterns, make decisions, identify problems, and feed other systems.
*  Without these additional steps of organizing and analyzing, oil and data are similar in that they are notably messy and unusable in their raw form.
*  As oil powered the industrial economies of the 19th and 20th centuries, data is powering the digital economies of the 21st century.
*  The big economic powerhouses are being powered by data, such as the technology firms Facebook and Google.


# Data Ownership
* Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets.
* These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable. For example, data associated with intellectual property — items such as copyrights and trade secrets — will likely have high degrees of protection, from accessibility rights to who can use the data and for what purpose.
* Data ownership refers to the legal rights and control that individuals or entities have over the data they generate, collect, or store.
* It encompasses the rights to access, use, transfer, and dispose of data, as well as the responsibility for its protection and security.
* In the context of personal data, data ownership often pertains to individuals' rights over information that relates to them personally, such as their name, contact details, health records, and online behavior.
* Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern data ownership and provide individuals with certain rights, such as the right to access their data, the right to request corrections or deletions, and the right to know how their data is being used.
* For businesses and organizations, data ownership extends to the data they collect or generate in the course of their operations, including customer data, proprietary information, and intellectual property.
*  Clear ownership rights are essential for businesses to protect their interests, maintain data integrity, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
*  However, data ownership can become complex, especially in cases where multiple parties are involved in generating or processing data, such as in collaborative research projects, joint ventures, or data-sharing agreements.
*  In such cases, it's important to establish clear agreements and protocols regarding data ownership, usage rights, and responsibilities to avoid disputes or misunderstandings.
*  As technology continues to evolve, new challenges related to data ownership are emerging, such as the rise of data generated by interconnected devices (IoT), the use of data in artificial intelligence systems, and the globalization of data flows. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and adaptation of legal frameworks to ensure that data ownership rights are effectively protected and balanced with other societal interests, such as innovation, competition, and privacy.

# Data Architecture
* When designing the technical needs of an organization to support its business strategy, this practice is known as enterprise architecture (EA).
* Using standards and established principles, organizations can analyze, design, plan, and implement the right technologies, policies, and projects to support business goals.
* A subset of EA is data architecture.
* in the same manner, which you can consider the holistic nature of EA in support of the organization’s strategy, data architecture is the manner in which data design and management decisions are being made to align with EA and in turn, with the business.
* Simply stated, data architecture is the agreed blueprint for how data supports an organization’s functions and technologies.
* When high-quality enterprises and data architectures both exist, organizations run more smoothly, and they can transform as conditions (either internally or in the marketplace) dictate.
* The absence or poor implementation of both can stifle digital transformation efforts, create high levels of complexity, and increase the possibility of failure.

* At a minimum, data architecture considers and typically supports the following:
* Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it.
* Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
* Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
* Adopting and agreeing to data standards
* Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication
* Data architecture is a direct reflection of data governance.
*  An established and functioning data architecture immediately signals that an organization values data, manages it as a critical business asset, and has controls in place to ensure that it aligns with business needs.
* like EA, data architecture is not the exclusive realm of technologists but a cross-organizational responsibility. In most medium to large organizations, data must efficiently flow across business silos, such as sales and product development, and serve many different audiences in multiple forms.

# The Lifecycle of Data

![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/445ff53e-3bd3-4774-9555-326f24adbeef)

* Creation:  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.
* Storage:  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.
* Usage:  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.
* Archival:  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.
* Destruction:  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.
* The idea that data is in different states at different times is an essential context of data governance.
*  Depending on the stage of its life, data may be treated differently and have unique requirements.
*  For example, the security needs of data being regularly used will differ from data in an archival state.

# Understanding the Impact of Big Data
* The Romans, for example, used ledgers to keep track of their various activities across their expansive empire.
* Fast-forward to the 20th century and the Cold War was instrumental in the technological leaps that resulted in microprocessors and the classical computing we use today.
*  One by-product of the Cold War, the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, accelerated innovation in computing and telecommunications.
* The Role of The U.S. Census in The Information Revolution
* Processing data on some form of computing device has been around since the late 1800s.
* In fact, the need for a mechanism to better tabulate the results of the U.S.
* constitutional requirement to conduct a population census every ten years is said to be the origin of data processing.
* Counting all the people and other data points in the 1880 census took almost eight years. It’s assumed it was full of errors.
* It was also a boring, tedious process. Credit for the first company to automate and commercialize the processing of this data goes to the Tabulating Machine Company, founded in 1896.
* To count census results, handwritten results were converted to punched holes in cards. For example, if a result for an individual was a “man,” then this was represented by a punched hole.
* A rod would attempt to pass through the hole to make an electrical connection with a pad on the other side.
*  With the electrical connection made, a counter would progress with an addition of one. These punch cards could be considered a form of data storage.
*  The Tabulating Machine Company was later renamed International Business Machines, IBM. The rest, as they say, is history.
*  These major developments and others culminated in what we now know as the third industrial revolution: the information age.
*  Data quickly became the raw material feeding a new generation of productivity and ideas.
*  Connectivity provided the arteries for information to freely flow across devices, organizations, and geographies with few limitations.
*  The result? Data creation, storage, and use exploded. By the turn of this century, we were creating data at unprecedented levels.
*  Data volume and velocity had become so unwieldy that it was creating a data swamp — a term for out-of-control amounts of data — that made it difficult for traditional software applications to manage.
*  Observing this notable phenomenon, someone smart came up with a term to describe the scale and challenge of all the data. They called it big data.

# Defining Big Data
* Big data is structured and unstructured data that is so massive and complex in scale, that it’s difficult and often impossible to process via traditional data management techniques.
* Defining Big Data
* One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:
* Volume: The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.
* Variety: There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.
* Velocity: With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.
* Variability:  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
* Veracity:  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.

* Drivers of Big Data
* At a technology conference in 2003, the then-CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt. At the time said that every two days the world was creating more data than all the data created since the dawn of civilization.
* Big data was a thing even before Android and Apple smartphones and apps started generating data.
* This was before we had connected billions of devices, called the Internet of Things (IoTs), which would eventually begin collecting all manner of data.
* Big data even predates videos of cats published every day on social media platforms.
* By the third decade of the 21st century, with so many devices connected and the world in a state of digital transformation, the volume of data being created had experienced a Cambrian explosion — a term the data science community has adopted from an early period in history notable for the rapid introduction of life into the natural environment.
*  We were regularly well into the zettabyte range of data and its growth curve was continuing relentlessly
*  In 2021, global technology use generated 79 zettabytes of data, and it is anticipated to hit 180 zettabytes in 2025.
*   A learner seeing this course in 2040 might read the previous sentence and not be impressed at such small numbers, the same way a 32GB smartphone was considered a large amount of space in 2015

* Consequences of Big Data
* While these big data statistics are impressive, they don’t really paint the full picture. It might be easy, for example, to assume that all the data is good quality.
* You might believe it is easy to analyze. You may even think it is easily accessible. Most of these assumptions and many related ones will likely be incorrect. For starters, up to 80 percent of data is unstructured.
*  That’s a challenge right there. The vast majority of organizations struggle with unstructured data.
*  In addition, a lot of this data is duplicative. Some of it will be bad data, which means it can’t be trusted, has errors, or includes some other substantive challenge.
*  We’ve shed light on just a few of the issues with big data, but the truth is that data at scale is providing incredible value to all types of organizations.
*   It’s also the source of remarkable innovation, from self-driving cars to optimized supply chains.

* What about small data?  
* While so many of our business activities in the digital economy are driven by big data, there are still a lot of small data sets that are instrumental in decision-making and day-to-day operations.
* Think about all the spreadsheets that come by your inbox, the short surveys, or those go-to lists that we’ve all compiled and can’t live without.
* It’s not nearly as glamorous as big data, but in some cases, it may be argued as valuable.
* Big questions can be answered in small data.
* In fact, big data is often more meaningful when broken into smaller, more manageable chunks - an increasingly popular definition of small data. 
Smaller, logically arranged data can be the way to make sense of big data. In some circumstances, it may be the only way.

* Enter the Realm of Smart Data
* Smart data has emerged as a new term that defines big data that’s been optimally prepared for use to deliver the highest business value.
*  Instead of being overwhelmed by the distractions inherent to the volume, velocity, and variety of data in big data sets, processes are applied to big data to prepare it for specific uses.
*   For example, marketing teams can target potential customers with precision. Analytics applications can use high-quality real-time data generated in a manufacturing setting.
*   Smart data uses new processes and tools to make the data most useful.
*    For example, the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) is now being applied to find patterns in unstructured big data and extract the data that is most relevant for a given application.
*  Using new methods such as AI reduces time, lowers errors, and enables the creation of data subsets that may not have been previously possible.
*  In addition, smart data solutions are often applied at the point of collection rather than a post-processing solution.
*  In the 21st century we must recognize that all data can have value — big, small, and smart. Data governance is concerned with data no matter what form it takes.

# CHAPTER 3: DRIVING VALUE THROUGH DATA
## Identifying the Roles of Data
* It's critical to ensure that data is high quality, secure, compliant, and accessible to the right people at the right time.
* Data isn’t something that just concerns the data analytics team or the information technology department. It’s also not something that is limited to decision-makers and leaders.
* Data matters to everyone.

### Operations
* Business operations concern themselves with a diverse set of activities to run the day-to-day needs and drive the mission of an organization.
* Each business has different needs, and operational functions reflect these specific requirements.
*  Some core functions show up in almost every organization. Consider payroll, order management, and marketing.
*  At the same time, some operational support won’t be required. Not every organization needs its own IT organization, or if it’s a service business, it may not have a warehouse.
*  Operations run on and are powered by a variety of data and information sources. They also create a lot of both, too.
*  The performance of operations is often easily quantified by data. For example, in a human resources (HR) function, they’ll want to know how many openings there are, how long openings are taking to fill, and who is accepting offers. 
*  there’s a multitude of data points to quantify the answers to these so that relevant decisions can be made.
*  Operations use data to make decisions, enable systems to run, and deliver data to internal and external entities.
*   For example, a regional sales team will deliver their monthly results to headquarters to be presented to vice presidents or the C-suite.
*  The performance of operations is often easily quantified by data.
*  Operations use data to make decisions, enable systems to run, and deliver data to internal and external entities.
*   For example, a regional sales team will deliver their monthly results to headquarters to be presented to vice presidents or the C-suite.
*   Many data functions in support operations are automated. For example, a warehouse inventory system may automatically generate a replenishment order when stock drops to a certain level. Consider all the notifications that systems generate based on triggers.

 ###   Strategy
* Every organization has a strategy, whether it’s articulated overtly or not.
*  At the organizational level, this is about creating a plan that supports objectives and goals.
*  It’s essentially about understanding the challenges to delivering on the organization’s purpose and then agreeing on the proposed solutions to those challenges.
*  Strategy can also be adopted at the department and division levels, but the intent is the same: understand the journey ahead and make a plan.
* Strategy leads to implementation and requires the support of operations to realize its goals. In this way, strategy and operations are two sides of the same coin.

* Done right, a data-driven strategy delivered with operational excellence can be a winning ticket.
* Creating a strategy typically comes down to a core set of activities.
* It begins with an analysis of the environment followed by some conclusions on what has been gathered.
*  Finally, a plan is developed, driven by some form of guiding principles. These principles may be derived from the nature of the work, the values of the founders, or some other factors.
*  Deeply tied to all these steps is the availability of good quality data that can be processed and analyzed and then turned into actionable insights.
* The right mix of data and non-data sources must be considered.
* A best practice for strategy development is to consider it an ongoing process.
*  This doesn’t mean updating the strategy every month — as strategies are intended to last for several years — but it may mean revisiting the strategy every six months and tweaking it as necessary.
*  Revisions to strategy should be guided by new data, which can mean new knowledge and new insights.
*  While a regular process of strategy revisions is encouraged, new information that suddenly presents itself can trigger an impromptu update.
*  In the 21st century, organizations need to react quickly to environmental conditions to survive.
*  Data will form the backbone of your response system.

### Decision-Making
*  It’s generally accepted in business that the highest form of value derived from data is the ability to make better-informed decisions.
*  The volume and quality of data available today have no precedent in history.
* Without even creating a single unit of raw data, there’s a universe of existing data and information at our fingertips.
*  In addition, increasing numbers of easy-to-use analysis capabilities and tools are democratizing access to insight.
*  Popular consumer search engines such as Google and Bing have transformed how we make decisions. Doctors, for example, now deal with patients who are more informed about their symptoms and their causes.
*  Within organizations, access to abundant data and information has resulted in quicker, timeous, and better-quality business decisions.
*   For example, executives can understand their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats closer to real time.
*   Even if the information is tentative in the interim, it’s vastly better than being in the dark until it may be too late.
*    While there’s little surprise that data-driven decision-making is a fundamental business competency, it all hinges on decision-makers getting access to quality data at the right time.
*    Abundant and out-of-date data are not synonymous with data value.
*  Bad data may be worse than no data. Bad data processed into information and then used as the basis for decisions will result in failure.
*   The outcome of decisions based on bad data could range from a minor mistake to job termination right up to the closing of the business.

###  Measuring
* Organizations are in a continuous state of measurement, whether it’s overt or tacit. Every observed unit of data contributes to building a picture of the business.
*  The often-used adage, what gets measured gets managed, is generally applicable.
*  That said, some things are hard to measure and not everything gets measured.
*  The aspiration for every leader is that they have the information they need when they need it.
*   You might not always think of it this way, but that information is going to be derived from data that is a result of some form of measurement.
*  Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative.
*   Quantitative data is most often described in numerical terms, whereas qualitative data is descriptive and expressed in terms of language.
*   The type of information desired directly correlates to the measurement approach. This is going to inform your choices of at least what, when, where, and how data is captured.
*   A general rule is only to capture and measure what matters. Some may argue that capturing data now to measure later has value even if there isn’t a good case yet.
*   I can buy that but be careful with your limited resources and the potential costs.


###    Monitoring
* This is an ongoing process of collecting and evaluating the performance of, say, a project, process, system, or another item of interest.
*  Often the results collected are compared against some existing values or desired targets.
*  For example, a machine on a factory floor may be expected to produce 100 widgets per hour.
*   You engage in some manner of monitoring in order to inform whether, in fact, this expectation is being met.
*   Across a wide range of activities, monitoring also helps to ensure the continuity, stability, and reliability of that being supervised.
* Involved in monitoring is the data produced by the thing being evaluated. It’s also the data that is produced as a product of monitoring.
* For example, the deviation from the expected result.
* The data produced through monitoring feeds reports, real-time systems, and software-based dashboards.
* A monitor can tell you how much power is left in your smartphone, whether an employee is spending all their time on social media, or if through predictive maintenance, a production line is about to fail.
* Monitoring is another process that converts data into insight and as such, exists as a mechanism to guide decisions.
*  The role of data in measurement and monitoring often go hand-in-hand. Intuitively you know you have to measure something that you want to monitor.
* Data monitoring is also the process of evaluating the quality of data and determining if it is fit for purpose.
*  To achieve this, it requires processes, technologies, and benchmarks.
*  Data monitoring begins with establishing data quality metrics and then measuring results over time on a continuous basis.
*   Data quality monitoring metrics may include areas such as completeness and accuracy.
* By continuously monitoring the quality of the data in your organization, opportunities and issues may be revealed in a timely manner.
* Then, if deemed appropriate, actions can be prioritized.

### Insight Management
* Data forms the building blocks of many business functions. In support of decision-making — arguably its most important value — data is the source for almost all insight.
* As a basic definition, business insight is sometimes referred to as information that can make a difference.
* It’s not enough to simply collect lots of data and expect that insight will suddenly emerge.
*  There must be an attendant management process.
*  Thus, insight management means ensuring that data and information are capable of delivering insight.
* Insight management begins with gathering and analyzing data from different sources. In order to determine what data to process, those responsible for insight management must deeply understand the organization’s information needs.
* They must be knowledgeable about what data has value. In addition, these analysts must know how information flows across the organization and who it must reach.
* With the data gathered and processed, analytics will be applied — this is the interpretation of the data and its implications.
* Finally, insight management involves designing and creating the most effective manner to communicate any findings.
* For different audiences, different mechanisms may be required. This is seldom a one-size-fits-all.
*  Some people will want an executive summary while others may want the painful details.
*  For simplicity, you can think of knowledge management as the organizational support structures and tools to enable insight to be available to employees for whatever reason they need it.

### Reporting
* Perhaps the most obvious manifestation of data and information management in any organization is the use of reports. Creating, delivering, receiving, and acting on reports are fundamental functions of any organization.
* Some say they are the backbone of every business.
* That sounds overly glamorous, but it does speak to the importance of reporting and reports.
* The content of a report, which can be summarized or detailed, contains data and information in a structured manner.
*  For example, an expenditure report would provide a basic overview of the purpose of the report and then support it with relevant information.
*  That could include a list of all expenditures for a department over a certain period or it could just be a total amount.
*   It will depend on the audience and purpose. The inclusion of visuals is popular.
*   The report may have a discussion of the findings and will conclude with a summary and sometimes a set of recommendations.
* Reports are typically online or physical presentations of data and information on some aspect of an organization.
*  For example, a written and printed report may show all the sales of a particular product or service during a specific period.
*   Sometimes a report is given verbally in person or via a live or recorded video. Whatever the format — and that’s less important today as long as it achieves its objective — a report is developed for a particular audience with a specific purpose.
* With so many uses of data and information, the purpose of reporting is largely about improved decision-making.
*  With the right information, in the right format, at the right time, business leaders are empowered to make better decisions, solve problems, and communicate plans and policies.
* While reports do empower leaders and give them more tools, they don’t guarantee the right decisions.
*  Knowing something is not the equivalent of making the right choices at the right time.

 ### Other Roles for Data
*  Artificial intelligence (AI):  Data is considered the fuel of AI. It requires a high volume of good data. With huge quantities of quality data, the outcomes of AI improve.
*  It’s from the data that AI learns patterns, identifies relationships, and determines probabilities.
*   In addition, AI is being used to improve the quality and use of data in organizations.
*   Problem-solving:  Acknowledging the close association with decision-making, it’s worth calling out problem-solving as a distinctive use of data. Data plays a role in how a problem is defined, determining what solutions are available, evaluating which solution   use, and measuring the success or failure of the solution that is chosen and applied.
*   Data reuse:  While we collect and use data for a specific primary purpose, data is often reused for entirely different reasons.
*   Data that has been collected, used, and stored can be retrieved and used by a different team at another time - assuming they have permission, including access and legal rights (notable controls within data governance).
*   For example, the sales team in an organization will collect your name and address in order to fulfill an order.
*    Later, that same data set may be used by the marketing team to create awareness about other products and services.
*    These are two different teams with different goals using the same data. Data reuse can be considered a positive given that it reduces data collection duplication and increases the value of data to an organization, but it must be managed with care so that it doesn’t break any data use rules.

# Improving Outcomes with Data
*  It begins with recognizing that data is an organizational asset
*  This simply means that it’s something that brings economic value to the organization.
*  It’s clear to see this when it is pointed out, but many team members don’t yet look at data this way.
*  When data is considered an asset - in fact, specifically a high-value asset - it often gets treated differently.
*  Perhaps the function that is most associated with data is the process of exploring it and looking for insights. Called data analytics, this is a comprehensive organizational function that requires skilled staff and tools.
*  With the emergence of big data, data analytics has become more complex and requires deeper skills, but it’s also made data more valuable and important to the business.

# Approaching Data as an Asset
* An asset is something that is owned by a person, an organization, or a government with the expectation that it can bring some economic benefit. This includes the generation of income, the reduction of expenses, or an increase in net worth.
*  An asset can be tangible or intangible.
*   Tangible assets are physical things such as inventory, machines, and property.
*   That’s stuff you can see and touch.
*   An intangible asset is the opposite; it’s a non-physical thing like software, copyrights, a brand, and goodwill. Data is an intangible asset.
*   Organizations care about both types of assets because they typically get captured in their financial accounts.
*   Listing the value of assets presents the true state of any organization and reflects its financial health.
*    In addition, capturing and valuing assets is required for determining tax obligations and for acquiring loans.
* After it is processed from its raw form, data has the potential to create enormous economic value for all manner of stakeholders.

#### examples of the economic value of data
* Improves operations.
* Increases existing revenue.
* Produces new forms of revenue.
* Builds relationships with customers and other stakeholders.
* Improves the quality of products and services.
* Contributes to competitive advantage.
* Enables innovation.
* Reduces risk.
* The net result of knowing that data is an asset, but not treating it the same way as other financial assets, means it often doesn’t get the attention and respect it deserves.
* In practical terms, this may mean that data is often taken for granted, not leveraged nearly as much as it could be, and not protected to the extent it must be.
* Recognizing that data is an asset is the first step to good data governance.
* When you think of data as an asset, you’ll be concerned with whether it is good or bad data.
*  You’ll pay attention to the data’s accuracy, completeness, validity, and more.
*  It means the organization will be mindful of whether data is being used as an organizational resource or being hidden in silos.
*  This will mean understanding how the data is being managed and who has responsibility for it. Without roles and accountabilities, data can’t truly be managed well.
*  Data is an asset and for its value to be leveraged, it must be governed. This may be one of the most important motivations for good data governance.


# Data Analytics
* In order to make sense of data, you have to apply specific tools and techniques.
* The process of examining data in order to produce answers or find conclusions is called data analytics.
* A formal and disciplined approach is conducted by a data analyst, and it’s a necessary step for any individual or organization that’s trying to make good decisions for their organization.
* The process of data analytics is varied depending on resources and context
  ### Basics steps in data analysis
 ![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/7b29fd6d-c4e1-4497-8ce1-245ed17b3a2a)
*  These steps commence after the problem and questions have been identified.

  ### The relative complexity and business value of four types of analytics
  ![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/57cce65d-0489-4897-8960-dd5f9ad34594)
 * Descriptive:  Existing data sets of historical data are accessed, and analysis is performed to determine what the data tells stakeholders about the performance of a key performance indicator (KPI) or other business objectives. It is insight on past performance.
 * Diagnostic:  As the term suggests, this analysis tries to glean from the data the answer to why something happened. It takes descriptive analysis and looks at the cause.
 * Predictive:  In this approach, the analyst uses techniques to determine what may occur in the future. It applies tools and techniques to historical data and trends to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes.
 * Prescriptive:  This analysis focuses on what action should be taken. In combination with predictive analytics, prescriptive techniques provide estimates of the probabilities of a variety of future outcomes. 

* Data analytics involves the use of a variety of software tools depending on the needs, complexities, and skills of the analyst.
*  Beyond your favorite spreadsheet program, which can deliver a lot of capabilities, data analysts use products such as R, Python, Tableau, Power BI, QlikView, and others.
*  If your organization is big enough and has the budget, one or more data analysts is certainly a minimum requirement for serious analytics.
*   With that said, every organization should now consider some basic data analytic skills for most staff.
*   In a data-centric, digital world, having data science as a growing business competency may be as important as basic word processing and email skills.

# Data Management
* Data management is not the same as data governance! But they work closely together to deliver results in the use of enterprise data.
* Data governance concerns itself with, for example, defining the roles, policies, controls, and processes for increasing the quality and value of organizational data.
* Data management is the implementation of data governance. Without data management, data governance is just wishful thinking. To get value from data, there must be execution.
* At some level, all organizations implement data management.
* If you collect and store data, technically you’re managing that data. What matters in data management is the degree of sophistication that is applied to managing the value and quality of data sets.
*  If it’s on the low side, data may be a bottleneck rather than an advantage.
*  Poor data management often results in data silos across an organization, security and compliance issues, errors in data sets, and overall low confidence in the quality of data.


### Who would choose to make decisions based on bad data?
*  good data management can result in more success in the marketplace.
* When data is handled and treated as a valuable enterprise asset: insights are richer and timelier, operations run smoother, and team members have what they need to make more informed decisions.
* Well-executed data management can translate to reduced data security breaches, and lower compliance, regulatory, and privacy issues. 
 * Data management processes involve the collection, storage, organization, maintenance, and analytics of an organization’s data.
 * It includes the architecture of technology systems such that data can flow across the enterprise and be accessed whenever and by whom it is approved for use.
 *  Additionally, responsibilities will likely include such areas as data standardization, encryption, and archiving.
 *  good data management provides the opportunity for significantly enhanced organizational performance.

### Governing Data
* Governing data means that some level of control exists to support a related policy.
* For example, an organization may decide that to reduce risk, there needs to be a policy that requires data to be backed up every day.
*  The control would be the documentation of the process and enforcement of that policy.
*  To fully realize the potential of data in your organization means that data must be governed.
*  Any time an organizational resource or asset is left unmanaged, it’s either a recipe for disaster or a missed opportunity.
*   Even a small amount of governance beats no governance every single day.

#### The success of governing data can be reduced to three essential factors:
* People:  While recognizing that data is increasingly created and used exclusively by machines without human intervention, handling and benefiting from data is still a highly people-centric exercise. Even in a machine-centric context, it’s people who are most often defining, designing, and maintaining data use.
* Policies:  A data policy contains a set of adopted rules by an organization that apply to the handling of data in specific conditions and for particular desired outcomes. These policies apply in areas such as quality, privacy, retention, and security. The number of policies is typically a reflection of the size of the organization, the industry, and the degree to which data is considered a high-priority asset. A
* Metrics:  It’s largely true, what gets measured gets managed. In developing policies in support of data governance, you have to consider how each is measured. For example, if a policy states that there shouldn’t be more than five risk events per month such as a regulatory requirement being out of compliance, then, assuming the metric is high to begin with, it should decrease over time.

# CHAPTER FOUR : TRANSFORMING THROUGH DATA
*  data monetization is when you acknowledge that data is an asset, you expect that data to bring economic benefits.

 ## Examining the Broader Value of Data
* The ability of team members to access data that they need for their work, without having to rely on specialists, is called data democratization.
* As organizations grow and more systems are employed, eventually no single person knows what data is available and where it is in the enterprise.
*  Without this knowledge, the ability to properly govern your data and leverage its value is greatly hampered. Without deliberate actions, data democratization becomes elusive.
*   data silo is a data repository controlled by an entity in an organization but not frequently shared or known by other parts of the business.
*   Data silos hinder business efficiencies because they reduce collaboration and increase data inconsistencies.
*    In addition, they are a source of risk, including security and regulatory issues.
* Data governance helps eliminate unnecessary data siloes and makes data discoverable and available whenever and wherever it adds value.
* Data catalogs, discussed in this chapter, are an essential way that data governance can help solve these limitations.
* Unfortunately, most organizations don’t automatically come with a universal search engine that can help locate and serve up any type of data or information stored in the enterprise.
*  Being able to tame and explore data sprawl — a term for the myriad of data types and sources that most businesses grapple with today — is not easily achieved without investing specialized effort.
*  The ease at which you access data from across the Internet via a browser is seldom the experience in a business.
*  In a weird twist, it’s often easier to find information about your organization by Googling it rather than using your own internal search systems. Of course, if the data is protected behind your organization’s firewall, a public search engine won’t help either.
*  Knowing what data is available is essential for the following reasons:
*  Better informed decision-making.
*  Ensuring compliance and regulatory requirements.
*  Lower costs by avoiding duplicate system and data efforts.
*  Improved data analytics and reporting
*  Higher performing systems
*  More efficient operations
*  Reducing data inconsistencies across the enterprise.
*  Fortunately, the vendor community is ready to help you build your internal search capabilities.

# Data Catalogs
* You can take a few approaches to assist your organization so that your team members can find data.
*  One option involves the creation of an enterprise search engine.
*   It’s certainly possible, but not easy, and will face some limitations such as the discoverability of confidential data that is deliberately siloed.
*   In addition, a search engine won’t necessarily provide insights on whether data is available, current, accurate, or complete.
*   Its common purpose is simply to provide you with the location of the data.
* Another, increasingly popular, method of data discoverability is the creation of an enterprise data catalog.
* Like a store catalog that categorizes products and includes details such as availability and price, a data catalog lists the availability of data sets and includes a wide range of valuable details about that data.

 ####  three essential benefits of data catalogs are:
 * Finding data: Helps users identify and locate data that may be useful.
 * Understanding data:  Answers a wide variety of data questions such as its purpose and who uses it.
 * Making data more useful:  Creates visibility, describes value, and provides access to information.
 * a data catalog delivers a comprehensive inventory that provides an enterprise view of all data.
 * This view provides essential insight that helps with leveraging data value and provides a robust tool to assist with data governance. 
#### A basic orientation of the components of a data catalog
![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/6d7ef8c6-87b4-4574-a4bc-1ffbec3c1ae6)
* A data catalog is more than just a list of all data sets.for many organizations, this feature alone would add enormous value.
*  What makes a data catalog particularly valuable is that it contains data about the data. It’s called metadata.
*  This content can be curated manually and also by automated processes which can acquire it from other sources.
*   Artificial intelligence (AI) is now playing a growing role in the latter.
*   A data catalog can contain three types of metadata: technical, business, and operational.
*   Technical metadata:  Data about the design of a data set such as its tables, columns, file names, and other documentation related to the source system.
*   Business metadata:  Organizational data such as a business description, how it is used, its relevancy, an assessment of data quality, and users and their interactions.
*   Operational metadata:  Data such as when the data was last accessed, who accessed it, and when was it last backed up.
*   For a large number of stakeholders ranging from data analysts to data stewards, a data catalog presents many advantages.
*    Primarily, the ability to find data tops the list. But it provides much more than that.
  ##### with a data catalog, an organization can:
* Know what data it has (and by extension, know what data is missing).
* Reduce data duplication.
* Increase operational efficiencies and innovation.
* Understand data quality.
* Manage compliance.
* Enjoy cost savings from improved operations.

* A well-managed data catalog can be transformational for an organization. The effort to create and maintain one should not be understated.
* But, without a doubt, a data catalog is often the basis for delivering successful data governance and data management.

# Case Study: Unlocking Data Silos With a Data Catalog
### From Data to Insights
* deriving insights is almost the entire point of collecting data.
* Insight provides a deep understanding of something and is the ultimate positive manifestation of data.
* It has the highest value to an organization because it can support decisions and drive actions.
* Whether an organization uses insight to support decisions or drive actions is a choice.
* Most organizations will do some of both, but when insights are used primarily to drive action, the value of the underlying data is truly realized.
*  Put another way, actionable data is the most valuable data to an organization.
*  if you can’t use your data to make better decisions and drive your organization forward, the data may just be worthless.


#### Acquiring and applying insight from data means defining the following:
* Context: Understanding the environment and objectives of the outcome
* Need: Determining how insight will help to accomplish the objective
* Vision: Having ideas about how insight will help and what that might look like in practice
* Outcome:  Specifying how insights will be adopted and success will be measured

* Converting data into insights is no easy task. It’s complicated and skilled work and relies on good quality data that is accessible.
*  Those tasked with delivering insights often cite data quality, data volume, work effort, and integrating data from various sources as the top reasons that make it difficult and create a deterrent to adoption.
*  The wrong actions taken in response to insights can have devastating business consequences.
*   Trusting insights requires a high degree of confidence in both those producing the analytics and those receiving the results.
*    While the vast majority of organizations want to rely on insights, recent surveys suggest that only a minority of leaders act on the insights provided.
* Quality insights can provide a competitive advantage and operational excellence, but organizations have work to do to fully realize their potential.

# Data Analytics
* to realize the benefits of data and discover insights, you need analytics.
* Analytics unlocks the power embedded in good-quality data.
* Data analytics involves both specialized skills and software to explore data sets and extract insights that may be useful to an organization.
* Sometimes the term is used interchangeably with data analysis.
* Data analysis is concerned with identifying a data set, examining it, and reporting on any findings.
* It’s a subset of data analytics and it typically focuses on what data from the past tells us.
On the other hand, data analytics is a complete science that involves collecting, cleaning, organizing, storing, administering, and analyzing data.
* The source of data for analytics is one or a combination of the following:
* First-party data:  Data that an organization collects.
* Second-party data:  Data that is obtained from another organization.
* Third-party data:  Aggregated data obtained from a provider.

#### Typical uses of contemporary data analytics tools and techniques include:\
* Vastly improved decision-making
* Focused marketing campaigns
* Understanding the competitive landscape
* Designing more innovative products
* Better customer service
* Improved operations
* Insights on customer behavior
* data analytics has matured considerably, and its value to businesses has skyrocketed.
* This is the result of all types of organizations recognizing and prioritizing the value of data, the advent of big data, the emergence of data science as a respected business competency, and the arrival of game-changing new analytics tools.
*  These tools now regularly incorporate AI to help identify patterns and relationships in data.
*   This AI can augment some of the traditional data analyst responsibilities to increase speed and accuracy.
*   Any organization that is serious about increasing the use of data for a wide range of business purposes must be ready to govern its data analytics capabilities.
*   This includes policies and procedures, experienced talent, and a suite of contemporary software tools.

# Data Monetization
* An asset is something owned that has the expectation of delivering value.
*  Unlike tangible assets such as inventory and property, data falls into the same category as assets such as copyrights and software.
*  Intuitively, when something has a high value, it’s likely to be treated differently from things with little value.
*  Without a process to place a price on a data set - called data valuation - the value of a given data set may be highly subjective and may differ considerably between the perspectives of team members.
*  When data provides an economic benefit to an organization, it's called data monetization. It’s a succinct, albeit cruder, way to generally consider the ultimate role of data in a for-profit enterprise.
*  Data valuation, while generally recommended in larger enterprises, is a requirement for advanced data monetization such as selling or licensing data.

##### Ways to determine data valuation:
* Cost value method:  Value is calculated by determining how much it costs to produce, store, and replace lost data. It’s a simple method and can be useful as a lightweight approach, but it is subjective and doesn’t necessarily account for the economic value that the data can produce.
* Market value approach:  Value is calculated by researching how comparable data is being priced in the open market. It’s a great approach if market-based comparable data exists but doesn’t work for the vast number of data sets that are not traded.
* Economic value approach:  Value is calculated by measuring the impact a data set has on the business’s bottom line. It’s a difficult approach because it may be nearly impossible to identify the specific value of the data relative to other contributors of value.
* With-and-without method:  Value is calculated by quantifying the impact on cash flow if a data set needs to be replaced. Scenarios with and without the data are explored and the difference between cash flow is used to determine data value. Like others, this can be challenging to pinpoint the specific impact of a data set.
* What’s clear from data valuation methods is that none of them are perfect. Above all, data valuation is very hard. But in practice don’t be discouraged. It’s hard for every type of organization. Fortunately, a number of providers are ready to help if you want outside assistance.
* Assuming your organization realizes that data is a strategic corporate asset, you must be intentional in how you manage that asset. Called data asset management, a business must know what data sets it has and understand their value. It must have a plan for utilization and a mechanism to measure return on investment.
* For optimal data monetization, organizations must manage high-value data with the same priority and rigor (and maybe even more) that it treats its most important tangible assets.

# Data-Driven Decision Making
*  the most important value for most enterprises to derive from data is the ability to make better, more-informed decisions.
* data-driven decision-making (DDDM) is the process of using data to drive business decisions.
* six-step process to data-driven decision-making:
* Define the objectives:  This step involves understanding the objectives relative to the effort and their alignment with organizational goals. This will help you scope the work and define the metrics. In fact, it can be useful to define success and then work backward. For example, if you’re trying to increase sales in a particular region, you need to identify which metrics to capture in order to determine whether you achieved that objective.
* Identify the data:  In addition to using a data catalogue, enterprise search, or similar, this step requires engaging with impacted stakeholders. Getting input from a diverse group of people and teams will help you scope the data. This may generate the need to gather data that doesn’t exist.
* Prepare the data:  After Step 2, you'll understand the degree of preparation you need. If the problem you’re trying to solve is narrow and the data is easily accessible and high-quality, you’ll be in pretty good shape. In most cases, your situation is unlikely to be simple. The data necessary to meet your decision-making objectives will likely come in a variety of formats and will be in need of some remediation.
* Analyze the data:  Once you reach this point, the most exciting part begins. The assumption is that you’re using a useful analytics tool. For complex analysis and continuous efforts, several tools will be used. This could include support for an ETL architecture (Extract, Transform, and Load). This is when data is extracted from one system and made ready and available for use in another. T\
* Determine the findings:  Once you have data that you can display in a variety of ways, you can ask questions about it. For example, if you’re trying to understand customer demographics relative to sales in a particular region, you may want to toggle between different age ranges. While all phases of DDDM have complexity, the tough work here is knowing which questions to ask. This skill is aided by training, but experience helps.
* Take action:  That’s all there is to this step. Make your decisions. If you’ve completed Steps 1-5 well, but no action is taken (assuming that’s not the decision based on analyzing the data since concluding that no decision is necessary is, in fact, a decision)
* While a first pass at a new problem will require most of these steps in sequence, it’s common to iterate through some of the steps to get to a good place for analysis.
* Data-driven decision-making - done right - can be a game-changer for any organization.
* With the culture, skills, and tools, better decisions will be made, and they’ll be made more quickly too.
* As a bonus, team members will feel more empowered, and the process will often lead to greater collaboration between business units.
