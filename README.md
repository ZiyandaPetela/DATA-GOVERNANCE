  # DATA-GOVERNANCE
# CHAPTER 1 : DEFININ DATA GOVERNANCE
# ABOUT DATA GOVERNANCE
* Data is one of the most important resources an organization possesses in today’s economy.
* When organizations don't  handle and control data that leads to missed opportunities for business growth, revenue enhancement, and the utilization of crucial insights.
* Moreover, these organizations expose themselves to increased risk in a world fraught with complicated regulatory demands and devastating cyberattacks.
* proficient data management and improved data quality can yield outstanding results for their organizations.
* Gaining a solid grasp of data governance will enable you to boost the value and quality of your organization's data, while effectively managing the risks and obligations that come with it.


# Defining Data Governance
* Data governance is grappling with a public relations challenge.
* data governance constitutes one of the most valuable initiatives that an organization can put into action at this time. 
* data governance can unlock the extraordinary potential of data, promote business expansion, and facilitate triumphant digital transformations, all the while mitigating substantial business risks.
* Once data governance is thoroughly grasped, organizations can reap its potent outcomes.
* Effective data management is crucial and should be a priority for every business leader.

# UNDERSTANDING DATA GOVERNANCE
* Data governance is a very simple concept about proactively managing yor data in order to support your organization to achieve its strategy and objectives and does this by improving the quality of your data.
* So data governance is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data.
* Need to use different policies such as :
* A pplicy to mandate how your organisation is going to manage data.
* Roles and Responsibities concerning data and processes detailing what needs to be done to manage data.

* What is meant by governance?
* Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.
* It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced.
* When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. Left ungoverned, the possibility of devolving into chaos is very probable.
* The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent.
* For example,governance in a public agency such as a city will differ greatly from that of a private enterprise.
* Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.
* Project governance, for example, is focused on a process for how project decisions are made and how communications are managed between stakeholders.
* Land governance, concerns itself with issues relative to land ownership and the rules under which decisions are made around land use and control.
*  The data needs to be accurate and current.
* Leaders want data to provide the basis for rich insights that enable timely and informed data-driven decision-making.
*  The legal department requires data to be handled by everyone in a manner consistent with laws and regulations.
* Product designers want data to inform creative decisions that align with marketplace demands and customer trends.
*  Security professionals are tasked with ensuring that the data is appropriately protected.
* To achieve these and other increasingly common business demands, you need some form of data control and accountability in your enterprise.
*  Quality results require the diligent management of your organization’s data.
* Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.
*  when data is managed well, it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise’s most abundant and important lever for success.
* Well-managed data can be transformational, and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture
* This is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers
* Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease.
* The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets (a fancy term for data with specific value to an organization, such as a customer or product record) is called enterprise information management (EIM).
* Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.


* Data Governance Versus Data Management
* Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data.
* *  For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.
* Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.

* Data Governance versus Information Governance
* Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences.
* Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.
* As a data governance practitionerbe will be  operating in both the data and information governance worlds each day.
* must understand the context of data, a concept known as data intelligence, and the desired business outcomes, to complement data governance efforts in a valuable manner.

* The Value of Data Governance
* Puts in place processes and policies to leverage the data’s value and reduce data risks, that organization is demonstrating a strong commitment to data controls and accountabilities. In other words, that organization values data governance.
* Data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.
* main advantages achieved by good data governance include:
* Improved data quality
* Expanded data value
* Increased data compliance
* Improved data-driven decision-making
* Enhanced business performance
* Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
* Increased data availability and accessibility
* Improved data search
* Reduced risks from data-related issues
* Reduced data management costs
* Established rules for handling data
* In the absence of formalized data governance, organizations will continue to struggle in achieving these advantages and may, in fact, suffer negative consequences. For example, poor-quality data that is not current, inaccurate, and incomplete can lead to operating inefficiencies and poor decision-making.


# CREATING A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM
* The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following.
* defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
* Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
* Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
* Achieving leadership approval.
* Designing and developing the program.
* Implementing the program.
* Monitoring and measuring performance.
* Maintaining the program.
*  data governance is achieved through a set of common elements.
# COMMON ELEMENTS OF A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM

# DEVELOPING A DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
* Can't buy a data governance program off the shelf.
* Regardless of how and to what degree you implement the elements of a data governance program, you’ll need a basic set of guiding concepts and a structure in which to apply them. This is called the data governance framework.
* there are many framework variations to choose from, including ISACA’s Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) IT governance framework, they share some common components that address people, processes, and technology.

# Qualities of a data governance framework

![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/7c0fcb88-211a-462a-acbf-e7521319a913)

* Leadership and Strategy
* data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.
* The disconnect between business goals and data governance is the number one reason that data governance programs fail.
*  When mapping organizational strategy to data governance, you need the support, agreement, and sponsorship of senior leadership

*  Roles and Responsibilities
*  Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.
*  Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.
*  While specific roles do exist, your organization must understand that data governance requires responsibilities from nearly everyone.


*  Policies, Processes, and Standards
* Policies, processes, and standards must include accountability and enforcement components; otherwise it’s possible they will be dead on arrival.
*  At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization.
*  Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.

*  Metrics
*  The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results.
*   Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.
*   You’ll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program.
*   Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.

*   Tools
* a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.
* many data science-related tools have made leaps in terms of incorporating ease-of-use and automation.
* What used to be complex has been democratized and empowered more team members to better manage and derive value from data.

* Communications and Collaboration
* With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key.
* This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
*  Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.
*  A large number of disparate stakeholders need to work together in order to effectively govern data.
*  Collaboration is essential and can be the difference between success and failure. Good collaboration requires a positive culture that rewards teamwork.
*   It also requires clear channels between teams, such as regular meetings. Online collaboration platforms are increasingly being used too.

# PREPARING FOR DATA GOVERNANCE
* Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it.
* if you and your team are diligent, there are some traps that you can avoid
* Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists.
* Intuitively can conclude that an immature, reactive data culture, where data is simply handled in an ad hoc manner, is an entirely different experience than a sophisticated data-driven culture.
* There are other prerequisites for data governance success, these include ensuring that the organization’s strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program.

* What is data culture?
* Data culture is an organizational culture of data-driven decision making. Organizations build a data culture because they want to make better decisions
* In a data culture, by contrast, evidence and reason are valued above all else.
* It doesn’t matter who’s talking or what tone they’re using — what matters is whether the argument makes sense given the data.
* Consensus and hierarchical cultures generally aren’t intentionally selected as preferred alternatives to data culture.
* Rather, they emerge because they’re easy. Y
*  But to be able to look at the data for answers, the data must be readily available, trustworthy, and interpretable.

* Assessing the Data Culture
* data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it.
* Effective data cultures support and empower all employees
* In a data culture, decisions don’t rely on gut feelings, guesses, or the opinion of the highest-paid/ranking person in the room. Rather, decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce.
* It’s been said that data culture is decision culture
* Data culture can be now considered a new way of doing business in the digital age.
*  implementing data governance will be a positive and important contributing factor to building a data culture.

# Maturing the Data Culture
* When it is needed to better prepare the organization for data governance by maturing the data culture,must do the following:
* Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
* Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
* Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
* Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

* Assessing Data Governance Readiness
* the success rate of data governance programs on the first try remains low.
*  It’s important to maximize the conditions for success.
*  Must check the followong to help determine the data governance readiness for organizations:
*  The basis of a data culture exists.
*  The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
*  Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
*  Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
*  One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
*  The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
*  The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
*  You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
*  Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
*  Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
*  The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.

# CHAPTER 2 : EXPLORING A WORLD OVERFLOWING WITH DATA 
* Each organization may have resource limitations that dictate the terms of their decision-making and actions
* The volume of data amassing may be the result of  day-to-day activities, products, and services, the data they have access to, or the data created and delivered by their customers and partners. Whatever the reason and source, this is the age of big data.
* overned and managed correctly, data has the potential to improve an organization’s operations and performance and increase profits and market share.

# Defining Data
* Data has a specific meaning and it’s really important to be clear on the definition
*  information is about knowledge and insights

*  Why all the focus on data?
*  Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device.
*  Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data.
*   the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts
*   Data is also defined based on its captured format.
*   Categories of Data :
*   Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
*   Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
*   Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.
*   Units of data are largely worthless until they are processed and applied
* The value that data can bring to so many functions, from product development to sales, makes it an important asset.

# The Zettabyte Era
*  We have two data types, qualitative and quantitative.
*  Qualitative which is Categorical, is non-numerical/descriptive, has two categories which are Nominal(Non-ordered) i.e ethnicity,hair color , and Ordinal (orderly) i.e class grades, date range opinions.
*  Quantitative which is Numerical , uses numbers. Has two categories which are Discrete(Countable) i.e number of facebook likes,final score of in football, and Continous(Measurable) i.e weight,temperature.
*  The "Zettabyte Era" refers to the current period in which digital data is measured in zettabytes.
*  A zettabyte is a unit of digital information storage equivalent to 1 sextillion bytes, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.
*   With the explosion of digital content, from videos and images to social media posts and sensor data, the amount of data generated and consumed globally has been rapidly increasing.
*   This era signifies not only the sheer volume of data being produced but also the challenges and opportunities it presents.
*   Managing, analyzing, and making sense of such vast amounts of data has become a critical task for businesses, governments, and individuals alike.
*    Technologies like big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have emerged to help harness the potential of this data deluge.
*    The Zettabyte Era is characterized by the ubiquity of data in everyday life, the rise of data-driven decision-making across industries, and the ongoing quest to innovate and develop new tools and strategies to effectively navigate this data-rich landscape.
*    It underscores the importance of digital literacy, data privacy, and cybersecurity in an increasingly interconnected world.

# From Data to Insight
* Data that is never used is about as useful as producing reports that nobody reads. The assumption is that you have data for a reason.
*  Data must be converted to information to have meaning.
*  Information is data in context
*  The Differences Between Data and Information
*  Data is Raw and are Items such as characters, words, pictures, and numbers that have no meaning in isolation. In data there is no analysis dependency
*  Data is Unorganized and not dependent on context
![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/4d1ba019-60d4-4961-a259-82eee5716786)
* Not typically useful alone
*  Information is Processed and is Data that is organized and given context to have meaning and Dependent on the analysis of data
*  information is organized and dependent on context
* Useful alone

* When we apply information coupled with broader contextual concepts, practical application, and experience, it becomes knowledge.
*  Knowledge is actionable. It may also give relevance to the saying that- knowledge is power.
*  With wisdom, we know what to do with knowledge and can determine its contextual validity.
*   We could have stopped at knowledge, but wisdom takes us to the ultimate destination derived from data. All wisdom includes knowledge, but not all knowledge is wisdom.
*    insight is an outcome that can emerge from knowledge but is best demonstrated through a combination of knowledge and wisdom.
*  With insight, we’ve gained a deeper understanding of something and have the skills to think or see it differently.

  # Journey fro data to insight
  ![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/61beb583-7c54-4099-bdda-77b8fdb48991)
  * the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy
  *Data leads to insight 
  * ![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/df0cd7cc-5cd2-4dec-bb48-a4da04feab6c)
* the best outcome can’t be guaranteed no matter which processes, tools, or skills are used, good practices such as the right level of data governance can absolutely lead to better results.

# The Role of Data in the 21st Century
* Since the early days of data processing in the 19th and 20th centuries right through to digital transformation in the 21st century, data has played many important roles.
*  It’s helped us understand the world in completely new ways, improved our ability to make better-informed decisions, and supported our efforts to solve all manner of problems.
*  In this way, it’s fair to say that data has always been important.
*  ince the mid-20th century, as more computer systems came online, the role of data has grown.
*  It’s not just that the quantity of data began to increase rapidly, but it was also the quality of the data and the availability of it to so many people.
*  In these early decades of the 21st century, we are producing more data than we can handle, and the depth, breadth, and quality of the data that is being used are reshaping not just the tools and capabilities of our industries and cities, but the nature of how we learn, socialize, and entertain ourselves.
*  It’s also elevating risks that we may previously have characterized as annoyances to a world today where a cyberattack can result in millions of dollars of losses in hours.

# Data-Driven Decision-Making
*  one of the greatest values of data is its ability to help us all make better decisions.
*  The availability of abundant good quality data has been a boon for decision-making.
*  if you make a decision based on bad data, your challenges will be entirely different.
*  Abundant data is a product of the 21st century, but quality data is the product of deliberate actions.
*   Data governance plays a central role when aspiring for data quality.

# Data as The New Oil
* Just as oil drove and grew economies in the past, data is doing that now.
* Some have subsequently added that just like oil, data has value but must first be processed to be useful.
*  Specifically, oil is refined to make gas, plastics, and other useful chemicals.
*  In a similar fashion, data must be organized and analyzed to understand patterns, make decisions, identify problems, and feed other systems.
*  Without these additional steps of organizing and analyzing, oil and data are similar in that they are notably messy and unusable in their raw form.
*  As oil powered the industrial economies of the 19th and 20th centuries, data is powering the digital economies of the 21st century.
*  The big economic powerhouses are being powered by data, such as the technology firms Facebook and Google.


# Data Ownership
* Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets.
* These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable. For example, data associated with intellectual property — items such as copyrights and trade secrets — will likely have high degrees of protection, from accessibility rights to who can use the data and for what purpose.
* Data ownership refers to the legal rights and control that individuals or entities have over the data they generate, collect, or store.
* It encompasses the rights to access, use, transfer, and dispose of data, as well as the responsibility for its protection and security.
* In the context of personal data, data ownership often pertains to individuals' rights over information that relates to them personally, such as their name, contact details, health records, and online behavior.
* Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern data ownership and provide individuals with certain rights, such as the right to access their data, the right to request corrections or deletions, and the right to know how their data is being used.
* For businesses and organizations, data ownership extends to the data they collect or generate in the course of their operations, including customer data, proprietary information, and intellectual property.
*  Clear ownership rights are essential for businesses to protect their interests, maintain data integrity, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
*  However, data ownership can become complex, especially in cases where multiple parties are involved in generating or processing data, such as in collaborative research projects, joint ventures, or data-sharing agreements.
*  In such cases, it's important to establish clear agreements and protocols regarding data ownership, usage rights, and responsibilities to avoid disputes or misunderstandings.
*  As technology continues to evolve, new challenges related to data ownership are emerging, such as the rise of data generated by interconnected devices (IoT), the use of data in artificial intelligence systems, and the globalization of data flows. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and adaptation of legal frameworks to ensure that data ownership rights are effectively protected and balanced with other societal interests, such as innovation, competition, and privacy.

# Data Architecture
* When designing the technical needs of an organization to support its business strategy, this practice is known as enterprise architecture (EA).
* Using standards and established principles, organizations can analyze, design, plan, and implement the right technologies, policies, and projects to support business goals.
* A subset of EA is data architecture.
* in the same manner, which you can consider the holistic nature of EA in support of the organization’s strategy, data architecture is the manner in which data design and management decisions are being made to align with EA and in turn, with the business.
* Simply stated, data architecture is the agreed blueprint for how data supports an organization’s functions and technologies.
* When high-quality enterprises and data architectures both exist, organizations run more smoothly, and they can transform as conditions (either internally or in the marketplace) dictate.
* The absence or poor implementation of both can stifle digital transformation efforts, create high levels of complexity, and increase the possibility of failure.

* At a minimum, data architecture considers and typically supports the following:
* Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it.
* Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
* Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
* Adopting and agreeing to data standards
* Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication
* Data architecture is a direct reflection of data governance.
*  An established and functioning data architecture immediately signals that an organization values data, manages it as a critical business asset, and has controls in place to ensure that it aligns with business needs.
* like EA, data architecture is not the exclusive realm of technologists but a cross-organizational responsibility. In most medium to large organizations, data must efficiently flow across business silos, such as sales and product development, and serve many different audiences in multiple forms.

# The Lifecycle of Data

![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/445ff53e-3bd3-4774-9555-326f24adbeef)

* Creation:  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.
* Storage:  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.
* Usage:  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.
* Archival:  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.
* Destruction:  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.
* The idea that data is in different states at different times is an essential context of data governance.
*  Depending on the stage of its life, data may be treated differently and have unique requirements.
*  For example, the security needs of data being regularly used will differ from data in an archival state.

# Understanding the Impact of Big Data
* The Romans, for example, used ledgers to keep track of their various activities across their expansive empire.
* Fast-forward to the 20th century and the Cold War was instrumental in the technological leaps that resulted in microprocessors and the classical computing we use today.
*  One by-product of the Cold War, the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, accelerated innovation in computing and telecommunications.
* The Role of The U.S. Census in The Information Revolution
* Processing data on some form of computing device has been around since the late 1800s.
* In fact, the need for a mechanism to better tabulate the results of the U.S.
* constitutional requirement to conduct a population census every ten years is said to be the origin of data processing.
* Counting all the people and other data points in the 1880 census took almost eight years. It’s assumed it was full of errors.
* It was also a boring, tedious process. Credit for the first company to automate and commercialize the processing of this data goes to the Tabulating Machine Company, founded in 1896.
* To count census results, handwritten results were converted to punched holes in cards. For example, if a result for an individual was a “man,” then this was represented by a punched hole.
* A rod would attempt to pass through the hole to make an electrical connection with a pad on the other side.
*  With the electrical connection made, a counter would progress with an addition of one. These punch cards could be considered a form of data storage.
*  The Tabulating Machine Company was later renamed International Business Machines, IBM. The rest, as they say, is history.
*  These major developments and others culminated in what we now know as the third industrial revolution: the information age.
*  Data quickly became the raw material feeding a new generation of productivity and ideas.
*  Connectivity provided the arteries for information to freely flow across devices, organizations, and geographies with few limitations.
*  The result? Data creation, storage, and use exploded. By the turn of this century, we were creating data at unprecedented levels.
*  Data volume and velocity had become so unwieldy that it was creating a data swamp — a term for out-of-control amounts of data — that made it difficult for traditional software applications to manage.
*  Observing this notable phenomenon, someone smart came up with a term to describe the scale and challenge of all the data. They called it big data.

# Defining Big Data
* Big data is structured and unstructured data that is so massive and complex in scale, that it’s difficult and often impossible to process via traditional data management techniques.
* Defining Big Data
* One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:
* Volume: The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.
* Variety: There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.
* Velocity: With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.
* Variability:  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
* Veracity:  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.

* Drivers of Big Data
* At a technology conference in 2003, the then-CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt. At the time said that every two days the world was creating more data than all the data created since the dawn of civilization.
* Big data was a thing even before Android and Apple smartphones and apps started generating data.
* This was before we had connected billions of devices, called the Internet of Things (IoTs), which would eventually begin collecting all manner of data.
* Big data even predates videos of cats published every day on social media platforms.
* By the third decade of the 21st century, with so many devices connected and the world in a state of digital transformation, the volume of data being created had experienced a Cambrian explosion — a term the data science community has adopted from an early period in history notable for the rapid introduction of life into the natural environment.
*  We were regularly well into the zettabyte range of data and its growth curve was continuing relentlessly
*  In 2021, global technology use generated 79 zettabytes of data, and it is anticipated to hit 180 zettabytes in 2025.
*   A learner seeing this course in 2040 might read the previous sentence and not be impressed at such small numbers, the same way a 32GB smartphone was considered a large amount of space in 2015

* Consequences of Big Data
* While these big data statistics are impressive, they don’t really paint the full picture. It might be easy, for example, to assume that all the data is good quality.
* You might believe it is easy to analyze. You may even think it is easily accessible. Most of these assumptions and many related ones will likely be incorrect. For starters, up to 80 percent of data is unstructured.
*  That’s a challenge right there. The vast majority of organizations struggle with unstructured data.
*  In addition, a lot of this data is duplicative. Some of it will be bad data, which means it can’t be trusted, has errors, or includes some other substantive challenge.
*  We’ve shed light on just a few of the issues with big data, but the truth is that data at scale is providing incredible value to all types of organizations.
*   It’s also the source of remarkable innovation, from self-driving cars to optimized supply chains.

* What about small data?  
* While so many of our business activities in the digital economy are driven by big data, there are still a lot of small data sets that are instrumental in decision-making and day-to-day operations.
* Think about all the spreadsheets that come by your inbox, the short surveys, or those go-to lists that we’ve all compiled and can’t live without.
* It’s not nearly as glamorous as big data, but in some cases, it may be argued as valuable.
* Big questions can be answered in small data.
* In fact, big data is often more meaningful when broken into smaller, more manageable chunks - an increasingly popular definition of small data. 
Smaller, logically arranged data can be the way to make sense of big data. In some circumstances, it may be the only way.

* Enter the Realm of Smart Data
* Smart data has emerged as a new term that defines big data that’s been optimally prepared for use to deliver the highest business value.
*  Instead of being overwhelmed by the distractions inherent to the volume, velocity, and variety of data in big data sets, processes are applied to big data to prepare it for specific uses.
*   For example, marketing teams can target potential customers with precision. Analytics applications can use high-quality real-time data generated in a manufacturing setting.
*   Smart data uses new processes and tools to make the data most useful.
*    For example, the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) is now being applied to find patterns in unstructured big data and extract the data that is most relevant for a given application.
*  Using new methods such as AI reduces time, lowers errors, and enables the creation of data subsets that may not have been previously possible.
*  In addition, smart data solutions are often applied at the point of collection rather than a post-processing solution.
*  In the 21st century we must recognize that all data can have value — big, small, and smart. Data governance is concerned with data no matter what form it takes.

# CHAPTER 3: DRIVING VALUE THROUGH DATA
# Identifying the Roles of Data
* It's critical to ensure that data is high quality, secure, compliant, and accessible to the right people at the right time.
* Data isn’t something that just concerns the data analytics team or the information technology department. It’s also not something that is limited to decision-makers and leaders.
* Data matters to everyone.

* Operations
* Business operations concern themselves with a diverse set of activities to run the day-to-day needs and drive the mission of an organization.
* Each business has different needs, and operational functions reflect these specific requirements.
*  Some core functions show up in almost every organization. Consider payroll, order management, and marketing.
*  At the same time, some operational support won’t be required. Not every organization needs its own IT organization, or if it’s a service business, it may not have a warehouse.
*  Operations run on and are powered by a variety of data and information sources. They also create a lot of both, too.
*  The performance of operations is often easily quantified by data. For example, in a human resources (HR) function, they’ll want to know how many openings there are, how long openings are taking to fill, and who is accepting offers. 
*  there’s a multitude of data points to quantify the answers to these so that relevant decisions can be made.
*  Operations use data to make decisions, enable systems to run, and deliver data to internal and external entities.
*   For example, a regional sales team will deliver their monthly results to headquarters to be presented to vice presidents or the C-suite.

*   Many data functions in support operations are automated. For example, a warehouse inventory system may automatically generate a replenishment order when stock drops to a certain level. Consider all the notifications that systems generate based on triggers.

* Strategy
* Every organization has a strategy, whether it’s articulated overtly or not.
*  At the organizational level, this is about creating a plan that supports objectives and goals.
*  It’s essentially about understanding the challenges to delivering on the organization’s purpose and then agreeing on the proposed solutions to those challenges.
*  Strategy can also be adopted at the department and division levels, but the intent is the same: understand the journey ahead and make a plan.
* Strategy leads to implementation and requires the support of operations to realize its goals. In this way, strategy and operations are two sides of the same coin.

* Done right, a data-driven strategy delivered with operational excellence can be a winning ticket.
* Creating a strategy typically comes down to a core set of activities.
* It begins with an analysis of the environment followed by some conclusions on what has been gathered.
*  Finally, a plan is developed, driven by some form of guiding principles. These principles may be derived from the nature of the work, the values of the founders, or some other factors.
*  Deeply tied to all these steps is the availability of good quality data that can be processed and analyzed and then turned into actionable insights.
