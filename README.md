  # DATA-GOVERNANCE
# CHAPTER 1 : DEFININ DATA GOVERNANCE
# ABOUT DATA GOVERNANCE
* Data is one of the most important resources an organization possesses in today’s economy.
* When organizations don't  handle and control data that leads to missed opportunities for business growth, revenue enhancement, and the utilization of crucial insights.
* Moreover, these organizations expose themselves to increased risk in a world fraught with complicated regulatory demands and devastating cyberattacks.
* proficient data management and improved data quality can yield outstanding results for their organizations.
* Gaining a solid grasp of data governance will enable you to boost the value and quality of your organization's data, while effectively managing the risks and obligations that come with it.


# Defining Data Governance
* Data governance is grappling with a public relations challenge.
* data governance constitutes one of the most valuable initiatives that an organization can put into action at this time. 
* data governance can unlock the extraordinary potential of data, promote business expansion, and facilitate triumphant digital transformations, all the while mitigating substantial business risks.
* Once data governance is thoroughly grasped, organizations can reap its potent outcomes.
* Effective data management is crucial and should be a priority for every business leader.

# UNDERSTANDING DATA GOVERNANCE
* Data governance is a very simple concept about proactively managing yor data in order to support your organization to achieve its strategy and objectives and does this by improving the quality of your data.
* So data governance is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data.
* Need to use different policies such as :
* A pplicy to mandate how your organisation is going to manage data.
* Roles and Responsibities concerning data and processes detailing what needs to be done to manage data.

* What is meant by governance?
* Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.
* It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced.
* When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. Left ungoverned, the possibility of devolving into chaos is very probable.
* The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent.
* For example,governance in a public agency such as a city will differ greatly from that of a private enterprise.
* Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.
* Project governance, for example, is focused on a process for how project decisions are made and how communications are managed between stakeholders.
* Land governance, concerns itself with issues relative to land ownership and the rules under which decisions are made around land use and control.
*  The data needs to be accurate and current.
* Leaders want data to provide the basis for rich insights that enable timely and informed data-driven decision-making.
*  The legal department requires data to be handled by everyone in a manner consistent with laws and regulations.
* Product designers want data to inform creative decisions that align with marketplace demands and customer trends.
*  Security professionals are tasked with ensuring that the data is appropriately protected.
* To achieve these and other increasingly common business demands, you need some form of data control and accountability in your enterprise.
*  Quality results require the diligent management of your organization’s data.
* Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.
*  when data is managed well, it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise’s most abundant and important lever for success.
* Well-managed data can be transformational, and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture
* This is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers
* Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease.
* The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets (a fancy term for data with specific value to an organization, such as a customer or product record) is called enterprise information management (EIM).
* Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.


* Data Governance Versus Data Management
* Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data.
* *  For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.
* Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.

* Data Governance versus Information Governance
* Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences.
* Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.
* As a data governance practitionerbe will be  operating in both the data and information governance worlds each day.
* must understand the context of data, a concept known as data intelligence, and the desired business outcomes, to complement data governance efforts in a valuable manner.

* The Value of Data Governance
* Puts in place processes and policies to leverage the data’s value and reduce data risks, that organization is demonstrating a strong commitment to data controls and accountabilities. In other words, that organization values data governance.
* Data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.
* main advantages achieved by good data governance include:
* Improved data quality
* Expanded data value
* Increased data compliance
* Improved data-driven decision-making
* Enhanced business performance
* Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
* Increased data availability and accessibility
* Improved data search
* Reduced risks from data-related issues
* Reduced data management costs
* Established rules for handling data
* In the absence of formalized data governance, organizations will continue to struggle in achieving these advantages and may, in fact, suffer negative consequences. For example, poor-quality data that is not current, inaccurate, and incomplete can lead to operating inefficiencies and poor decision-making.


# CREATING A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM
* The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following.
* defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
* Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
* Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
* Achieving leadership approval.
* Designing and developing the program.
* Implementing the program.
* Monitoring and measuring performance.
* Maintaining the program.
*  data governance is achieved through a set of common elements.
# COMMON ELEMENTS OF A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM

# DEVELOPING A DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
* Can't buy a data governance program off the shelf.
* Regardless of how and to what degree you implement the elements of a data governance program, you’ll need a basic set of guiding concepts and a structure in which to apply them. This is called the data governance framework.
* there are many framework variations to choose from, including ISACA’s Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) IT governance framework, they share some common components that address people, processes, and technology.

# Qualities of a data governance framework

* Leadership and Strategy
* data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.
* The disconnect between business goals and data governance is the number one reason that data governance programs fail.
*  When mapping organizational strategy to data governance, you need the support, agreement, and sponsorship of senior leadership

*  Roles and Responsibilities
*  Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.
*  Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.
*  While specific roles do exist, your organization must understand that data governance requires responsibilities from nearly everyone.


*  Policies, Processes, and Standards
* Policies, processes, and standards must include accountability and enforcement components; otherwise it’s possible they will be dead on arrival.
*  At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization.
*  Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.

*  Metrics
*  The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results.
*   Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.
*   You’ll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program.
*   Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.

*   Tools
* a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.
* many data science-related tools have made leaps in terms of incorporating ease-of-use and automation.
* What used to be complex has been democratized and empowered more team members to better manage and derive value from data.

* Communications and Collaboration
* With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key.
* This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
*  Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.
*  A large number of disparate stakeholders need to work together in order to effectively govern data.
*  Collaboration is essential and can be the difference between success and failure. Good collaboration requires a positive culture that rewards teamwork.
*   It also requires clear channels between teams, such as regular meetings. Online collaboration platforms are increasingly being used too.

# PREPARING FOR DATA GOVERNANCE
* Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it.
* if you and your team are diligent, there are some traps that you can avoid
* Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists.
* Intuitively can conclude that an immature, reactive data culture, where data is simply handled in an ad hoc manner, is an entirely different experience than a sophisticated data-driven culture.
* There are other prerequisites for data governance success, these include ensuring that the organization’s strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program.

* What is data culture?
* Data culture is an organizational culture of data-driven decision making. Organizations build a data culture because they want to make better decisions
* In a data culture, by contrast, evidence and reason are valued above all else.
* It doesn’t matter who’s talking or what tone they’re using — what matters is whether the argument makes sense given the data.
* Consensus and hierarchical cultures generally aren’t intentionally selected as preferred alternatives to data culture.
* Rather, they emerge because they’re easy. Y
*  But to be able to look at the data for answers, the data must be readily available, trustworthy, and interpretable.

* Assessing the Data Culture
* data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it.
* Effective data cultures support and empower all employees
* In a data culture, decisions don’t rely on gut feelings, guesses, or the opinion of the highest-paid/ranking person in the room. Rather, decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce.
* It’s been said that data culture is decision culture
* Data culture can be now considered a new way of doing business in the digital age.
*  implementing data governance will be a positive and important contributing factor to building a data culture.

# Maturing the Data Culture
* When it is needed to better prepare the organization for data governance by maturing the data culture,must do the following:
* Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
* Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
* Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
* Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

* Assessing Data Governance Readiness
* the success rate of data governance programs on the first try remains low.
*  It’s important to maximize the conditions for success.
*  Must check the followong to help determine the data governance readiness for organizations:
*  The basis of a data culture exists.
*  The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
*  Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
*  Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
*  One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
*  The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
*  The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
*  You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
*  Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
*  Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
*  The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.

# CHAPTER 2 : EXPLORING A WORLD OVERFLOWING WITH DATA 
* Each organization may have resource limitations that dictate the terms of their decision-making and actions
* The volume of data amassing may be the result of  day-to-day activities, products, and services, the data they have access to, or the data created and delivered by their customers and partners. Whatever the reason and source, this is the age of big data.
* overned and managed correctly, data has the potential to improve an organization’s operations and performance and increase profits and market share.

# Defining Data
* Data has a specific meaning and it’s really important to be clear on the definition
*  information is about knowledge and insights

*  Why all the focus on data?
*  Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device.
*  Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data.
*   the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts
*   Data is also defined based on its captured format.
*   Categories of Data :
*   Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
*   Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
*   Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.
*   Units of data are largely worthless until they are processed and applied
* The value that data can bring to so many functions, from product development to sales, makes it an important asset.

# The Zettabyte Era
*  We have two data types, qualitative and quantitative.
*  Qualitative which is Categorical, is non-numerical/descriptive, has two categories which are Nominal(Non-ordered) i.e ethnicity,hair color , and Ordinal (orderly) i.e class grades, date range opinions.
*  Quantitative which is Numerical , uses numbers. Has two categories which are Discrete(Countable) i.e number of facebook likes,final score of in football, and Continous(Measurable) i.e weight,temperature.
*  The "Zettabyte Era" refers to the current period in which digital data is measured in zettabytes.
*  A zettabyte is a unit of digital information storage equivalent to 1 sextillion bytes, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.
*   With the explosion of digital content, from videos and images to social media posts and sensor data, the amount of data generated and consumed globally has been rapidly increasing.
*   This era signifies not only the sheer volume of data being produced but also the challenges and opportunities it presents.
*   Managing, analyzing, and making sense of such vast amounts of data has become a critical task for businesses, governments, and individuals alike.
*    Technologies like big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have emerged to help harness the potential of this data deluge.
*    The Zettabyte Era is characterized by the ubiquity of data in everyday life, the rise of data-driven decision-making across industries, and the ongoing quest to innovate and develop new tools and strategies to effectively navigate this data-rich landscape.
*    It underscores the importance of digital literacy, data privacy, and cybersecurity in an increasingly interconnected world.

# From Data to Insight
* Data that is never used is about as useful as producing reports that nobody reads. The assumption is that you have data for a reason.
*  Data must be converted to information to have meaning.
*  Information is data in context
*  The Differences Between Data and Information
*  Data is Raw and are Items such as characters, words, pictures, and numbers that have no meaning in isolation. In data there is no analysis dependency
*  Data is Unorganized and not dependent on context
![image](https://github.com/ZiyandaPetela/DATA-GOVERNANCE/assets/123364433/4d1ba019-60d4-4961-a259-82eee5716786)
* Not typically useful alone
*  Information is Processed and is Data that is organized and given context to have meaning and Dependent on the analysis of data
*  information is organized and dependent on context
* Useful alone

* When we apply information coupled with broader contextual concepts, practical application, and experience, it becomes knowledge.
*  Knowledge is actionable. It may also give relevance to the saying that- knowledge is power.
*  With wisdom, we know what to do with knowledge and can determine its contextual validity.
*   We could have stopped at knowledge, but wisdom takes us to the ultimate destination derived from data. All wisdom includes knowledge, but not all knowledge is wisdom.
*    insight is an outcome that can emerge from knowledge but is best demonstrated through a combination of knowledge and wisdom.
*  With insight, we’ve gained a deeper understanding of something and have the skills to think or see it differently.

  # Journey fro data to insight

* the best outcome can’t be guaranteed no matter which processes, tools, or skills are used, good practices such as the right level of data governance can absolutely lead to better results.

# The Role of Data in the 21st Century
* Since the early days of data processing in the 19th and 20th centuries right through to digital transformation in the 21st century, data has played many important roles.
*  It’s helped us understand the world in completely new ways, improved our ability to make better-informed decisions, and supported our efforts to solve all manner of problems.
*  In this way, it’s fair to say that data has always been important.
*  ince the mid-20th century, as more computer systems came online, the role of data has grown.
*  It’s not just that the quantity of data began to increase rapidly, but it was also the quality of the data and the availability of it to so many people.
*  In these early decades of the 21st century, we are producing more data than we can handle, and the depth, breadth, and quality of the data that is being used are reshaping not just the tools and capabilities of our industries and cities, but the nature of how we learn, socialize, and entertain ourselves.
*  It’s also elevating risks that we may previously have characterized as annoyances to a world today where a cyberattack can result in millions of dollars of losses in hours.

# Data-Driven Decision-Making
*  one of the greatest values of data is its ability to help us all make better decisions.
*  The availability of abundant good quality data has been a boon for decision-making.
*  if you make a decision based on bad data, your challenges will be entirely different.
*  Abundant data is a product of the 21st century, but quality data is the product of deliberate actions.
*   Data governance plays a central role when aspiring for data quality.

# Data as The New Oil
* Just as oil drove and grew economies in the past, data is doing that now.
* Some have subsequently added that just like oil, data has value but must first be processed to be useful.
*  Specifically, oil is refined to make gas, plastics, and other useful chemicals.
*  In a similar fashion, data must be organized and analyzed to understand patterns, make decisions, identify problems, and feed other systems.
*  Without these additional steps of organizing and analyzing, oil and data are similar in that they are notably messy and unusable in their raw form.
*  As oil powered the industrial economies of the 19th and 20th centuries, data is powering the digital economies of the 21st century.
*  The big economic powerhouses are being powered by data, such as the technology firms Facebook and Google.
