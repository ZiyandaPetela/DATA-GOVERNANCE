# UNDERSTANDING DATA GOVERNANCE
* Data governance is a very simple concept about proactively managing yor data in order to support your organization to achieve its strategy and objectives and does this by improving the quality of your data.
* So data governance is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data.
* Need to use different policies such as :
* A pplicy to mandate how your organisation is going to manage data.
* Roles and Responsibities concerning data and processes detailing what needs to be done to manage data.

* What is meant by governance?
* Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.
* It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced.
* When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. Left ungoverned, the possibility of devolving into chaos is very probable.
* The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent.
* For example,governance in a public agency such as a city will differ greatly from that of a private enterprise.
* Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.
* Project governance, for example, is focused on a process for how project decisions are made and how communications are managed between stakeholders.
* Land governance, concerns itself with issues relative to land ownership and the rules under which decisions are made around land use and control.
*  The data needs to be accurate and current.
* Leaders want data to provide the basis for rich insights that enable timely and informed data-driven decision-making.
*  The legal department requires data to be handled by everyone in a manner consistent with laws and regulations.
* Product designers want data to inform creative decisions that align with marketplace demands and customer trends.
*  Security professionals are tasked with ensuring that the data is appropriately protected.
* To achieve these and other increasingly common business demands, you need some form of data control and accountability in your enterprise.
*  Quality results require the diligent management of your organization’s data.
* Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.
*  when data is managed well, it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise’s most abundant and important lever for success.
* Well-managed data can be transformational, and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture
* This is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers
* Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease.
* The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets (a fancy term for data with specific value to an organization, such as a customer or product record) is called enterprise information management (EIM).
* Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.


* Data Governance Versus Data Management
* Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data.
* *  For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.
* Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.

* Data Governance versus Information Governance
* Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences.
* Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.
* As a data governance practitionerbe will be  operating in both the data and information governance worlds each day.
* must understand the context of data, a concept known as data intelligence, and the desired business outcomes, to complement data governance efforts in a valuable manner.
